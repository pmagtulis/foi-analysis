# foi-analysis

This follows the **foi-ph-scraper** notebook and collates over 95,000 FOI requests into one file for analysis.

# What is this?

This is a code meant to run analysis on requests filed under the Philippines' **Freedom of Information** under Executive Order No. 2, Series of 2016 issued by
President Rodrigo Duterte. It analyzes the requests on various fronts such as trends, break from trends, agency treatment, types of requests, etc.

# Where does the information come from?

The bulk of data here came from a publicly accessible CSV file from the Presidential Communications Office, which manages the FOI portal. The CSV file is uploaded 
on this repository.

In addition, to cover for newer data specifically for 2022, we scraped information directly from the FOI website itself and **merged** them with the contents of
the CSV file. Over 96,000 records had been generated and cleaned.
